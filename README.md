# Bitcoin-Market-Watch-Final-Project

#The idea for this project is quite simple, I want to be able to pull data from the exchanges I use to trade bitcoin and #monitor their prices whenever I feel the impulse. That way if I have some extra cash or I need extra money I know the best #place to buy and sell and make a more informed decision.
